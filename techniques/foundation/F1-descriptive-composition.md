# F1: Descriptive Scene Composition

> **Core Principle**: Write narrative scene descriptions instead of keyword lists

## Overview

The single most important technique for Nano Banana Pro is writing descriptive, narrative prompts. The model's deep language understanding means flowing sentences outperform disconnected keywords.

**Time to Master**: 30 minutes
**Difficulty**: Beginner
**Prerequisites**: None

## The Problem with Keywords

### ❌ Keyword List Approach
```
coffee, cup, table, morning, sunlight, steam, wooden, ceramic
```

**Why This Fails**:
- No spatial relationships defined
- Ambiguous connections between elements
- Model must guess composition
- Inconsistent results

### ✅ Descriptive Narrative Approach
```
A ceramic coffee cup with visible steam rising from hot coffee,
positioned on a weathered wooden table. Morning sunlight streams
through a nearby window, creating warm highlights on the cup's surface
and casting long shadows across the table.
```

**Why This Works**:
- Clear spatial relationships ("on table", "through window")
- Defined attributes ("weathered wooden", "warm highlights")
- Compositional guidance ("long shadows across")
- Model understands intent

## The Anatomy of a Great Prompt

### Basic Structure
```
[Primary Subject] + [Key Attributes] + [Environment/Context] +
[Lighting] + [Mood/Atmosphere]
```

### Detailed Example Breakdown

```
A vintage leather journal with worn edges and brass clasp,
lying open on an antique mahogany desk. Afternoon light
filters through sheer curtains, illuminating handwritten
pages. Nearby, a fountain pen and reading glasses suggest
recent use. The scene evokes quiet contemplation and nostalgia.
```

**Analysis**:
- **Primary Subject**: "vintage leather journal"
- **Key Attributes**: "worn edges and brass clasp", "lying open"
- **Environment**: "antique mahogany desk"
- **Lighting**: "afternoon light filters through sheer curtains"
- **Supporting Elements**: "fountain pen and reading glasses"
- **Mood**: "quiet contemplation and nostalgia"

## Progressive Examples

### Level 1: Basic Description
```
A red apple on a white plate.
```

**Adequate for**: Simple, straightforward compositions
**Limitation**: Generic, lacks character

### Level 2: Enhanced Description
```
A crisp red apple with water droplets on its skin,
centered on a white ceramic plate against a neutral background.
```

**Better because**:
- Specific attributes ("crisp", "water droplets")
- Material description ("ceramic")
- Composition hint ("centered")
- Context ("neutral background")

### Level 3: Narrative Description
```
A freshly washed red apple, still glistening with water droplets,
rests on a pristine white ceramic plate. The minimalist composition
features soft, even lighting that highlights the apple's vibrant
color and smooth texture. Shot from a 45-degree angle, the scene
conveys freshness and simplicity, perfect for clean product photography.
```

**Professional because**:
- Story element ("freshly washed")
- Sensory details ("glistening", "vibrant", "smooth")
- Technical specs ("45-degree angle", "soft, even lighting")
- Purpose stated ("clean product photography")

## Prompt Patterns

### Pattern 1: Subject-First
```
[Subject with attributes], [action/position], [environment].
[Lighting description]. [Mood/style note].
```

**Example**:
```
A sleek modern laptop with glowing screen, positioned at an angle
on a minimalist desk workspace. Soft blue ambient lighting creates
a tech-forward atmosphere. Clean, professional aesthetic.
```

### Pattern 2: Scene-First
```
[Environment description] where [subject] [action/position].
[Lighting]. [Additional details].
```

**Example**:
```
A cozy coffee shop corner where a ceramic mug steams gently beside
an open book. Warm pendant lighting casts a golden glow over the
wooden table. Soft focus background suggests a quiet afternoon.
```

### Pattern 3: Story-Driven
```
[Context/story setup]. [Subject details]. [Environmental elements].
[Sensory or emotional conclusion].
```

**Example**:
```
In a sun-drenched artist's studio, paint-splattered brushes stand
in a ceramic jar, surrounded by tubes of vibrant oil paint. Late
afternoon light streams across the worktable, illuminating dried
paint textures and creative chaos. The scene captures artistic
energy mid-workflow.
```

## Practical Exercises

### Exercise 1: Keyword to Narrative
Transform these keywords into descriptive prompts:

**Keywords**: flower, vase, window, light, pink
**Your Prompt**:
```
_____________________________________________________
_____________________________________________________
_____________________________________________________
```

**Example Solution**:
```
A delicate pink peony in a clear glass vase, positioned on a
windowsill where morning light filters through the petals,
creating soft translucent edges. Gentle shadows fall across
the white surface below.
```

### Exercise 2: Add Layers
Start basic, then enhance:

**Base**: A desk with a laptop
**Add Lighting**: ...with warm task lighting illuminating the keyboard
**Add Context**: ...in a modern home office with minimalist decor
**Add Mood**: ...creating a focused, productive late-night work atmosphere

**Full Prompt**:
```
_____________________________________________________
_____________________________________________________
_____________________________________________________
```

### Exercise 3: Sensory Details
Choose a simple subject and add:
- Visual texture
- Light quality
- Spatial relationship
- Atmospheric mood

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Over-Stuffing
❌ **Too Many Elements**:
```
Coffee cup, laptop, phone, notebook, pen, glasses, plant, books,
lamp, mouse, keyboard, calendar, sticky notes, coasters...
```

✅ **Focused Description**:
```
A workspace featuring an open laptop and steaming coffee cup,
with a small succulent plant adding life to the minimalist setup.
```

**Lesson**: Choose 2-4 key elements, describe them well.

### Mistake 2: Vague Generalities
❌ **Generic**:
```
A nice room with good lighting
```

✅ **Specific**:
```
A sunlit living room with floor-to-ceiling windows, where afternoon
light creates geometric shadow patterns across hardwood floors.
```

**Lesson**: Replace vague words (nice, good, beautiful) with specific descriptions.

### Mistake 3: Missing Relationships
❌ **Disconnected**:
```
A book. A cup. A table. Light.
```

✅ **Connected**:
```
A leather-bound book lies open beside a ceramic cup on a rustic
wooden table, both illuminated by soft window light.
```

**Lesson**: Use spatial prepositions (on, beside, beneath, through).

## Advanced Tips

### Tip 1: Layer Your Details
Build from general to specific:
```
[General scene] → [Key subject] → [Specific details] → [Lighting/mood]
```

### Tip 2: Use Active Language
Instead of "there is a cup on a table"
Write: "a ceramic cup rests on a weathered wooden table"

### Tip 3: Imply Scale and Context
```
"A person holds a small ceramic cup" (shows scale)
"Espresso cup" (implies size through object type)
```

### Tip 4: Reference Visual Conventions
```
"Product photography style"
"Editorial magazine aesthetic"
"Film noir lighting"
"Wes Anderson color palette"
```

## Real-World Applications

### E-Commerce Product
**Bad**: "Headphones, black, wireless"

**Good**:
```
Professional wireless headphones in matte black, positioned at a
dynamic angle to showcase the padded ear cups and adjustable headband.
Clean white background with subtle shadow for depth. Product photography
lighting highlights premium materials and build quality.
```

### Blog Header
**Bad**: "Writing, laptop, coffee"

**Good**:
```
Overhead view of a creative workspace: an open laptop displays a
writing application beside a handwritten journal and steaming coffee
mug. Warm desk lamp lighting creates an inviting, productive atmosphere
for content creation.
```

### Social Media Post
**Bad**: "Food, plate, restaurant"

**Good**:
```
Artfully plated pasta dish with fresh basil garnish, photographed from
directly above on rustic ceramic. Natural restaurant lighting creates
appetizing highlights on the sauce. Instagram-ready food photography
aesthetic.
```
